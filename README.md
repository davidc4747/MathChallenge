Math Challenge
====

Math Challenge is a fun, simple, and addicting math game. 

It starts by asking simple addition questions(ex: 7+4, 14+9). Then it slowly ramps up the difficulty. First by generating more complex addition question(ex: 84+114+92), then by adding different types of questions: subtraction, multiplication, division. 
The higher your score, the more challenging the question will be.

You have to answer each question in less than a minute. If you don't you'll get no points for that question. The faster you answer, the more points you get. And for every correct answer your multiplier goes up, but time is always working against you. 

Your point value and multiplier are always trying to go to 0, and if you ever want to beat your friend's high score you'll have to be fast.
